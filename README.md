## Components

### 1. Adders

This project explores several adder designs:

*   **Half Adder:** The fundamental building block, adding two single-bit inputs (A, B) and producing a sum (S) and carry-out (Cout).
    *   Boolean Equations:
        *   `Sum = A XOR B`
        *   `Carry = A AND B`
    *   Implementation: See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/` (Java and C), and `docs/reports/docs/hardware-half-adder-implementation.txt` for LTSpice details.
*   **Full Adder:** Extends the half adder by including a carry-in (Cin) input, allowing for the chaining of adders.
    *   Boolean Equations:
        *   `Sum = (A XOR B) XOR Cin`
        *   `Carry = (A AND B) OR (Cin AND (A XOR B))`
    *   Implementation: See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/` (Java and C), and `docs/reports/markdown-reports/report-one.md` for a detailed report.
*   **Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA):**  A multi-bit adder created by chaining multiple full adders together.  The carry-out of each full adder becomes the carry-in of the next.
    *   Implementation:  Conceptual design in `src/microarch/labs/lab2/overview/lab2_overview.md` and `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/README.md`.
*    **Carry Lookahead Adder:** Described in the reports, but not fully implemented in code.

### 2. Simplified Computer Architecture

The project also includes a simplified computer architecture that incorporates the adder within an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Key components include:

*   **ALU:** Performs arithmetic (addition/subtraction) and logical operations.  Uses a 4-bit Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA) for addition.
*   **Register File:**  Provides temporary storage for operands and results.
*   **Instruction Memory (ROM):** Stores the program instructions.
*   **Data Memory (SRAM):** Stores data operands.
*   **Control Unit:** Decodes instructions and generates control signals to orchestrate data flow.

    *   See `docs/reports/markdown-reports/report-one.md`, `docs/reports/docs/lab3a-report-writing-guide.md`, and `docs/reports/markdown-reports/updated.md` for detailed descriptions of the architecture.

## Implementation Languages

*   **Java:** Used for a modular, object-oriented implementation of the full adder, including event-driven simulation and unit testing.  (See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java/`)
*   **C:**  Provides a lower-level implementation of the full adder, demonstrating gate-level logic. (See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/c/`)
*   **LTSpice:** Used for circuit simulation and verification.  Netlists and subcircuit definitions are discussed in various reports and templates. (See `src/microarch/labs/week3lab3/templates/`, `docs/reports/docs/hardware-half-adder-implementation.txt`)

### LTSpice Simulation

LTSpice is used for simulating the digital circuits designed in this project. While the codebase doesn't contain pre-built LTSpice files, the documentation and templates provide guidance on creating them.

*   **Netlist Creation:**  You will need to create `.asc` (schematic) files in LTSpice based on the gate-level designs described in the reports (e.g., `docs/reports/docs/hardware-half-adder-implementation.txt` for the half adder).
*   **Symbol Files:**  You may need to create `.asy` (symbol) files for custom gates or subcircuits if you are building from basic components.
*   **Behavioral Sources:**  As mentioned in `src/microarch/labs/week3lab3/templates/full-adder-design-template.md`, you can use behavioral voltage sources (B-sources) in LTSpice to directly implement Boolean logic equations, which can be a quicker way to simulate the functionality.
*   **Simulation Setup:**  Use voltage sources to represent digital inputs (e.g., 0V for logic '0', 5V or 3.3V for logic '1').  Use `.tran` statements to run transient simulations and observe the waveforms.

**(Placeholder - If you have example LTSpice `.asc` files, consider adding them to the repository (e.g., in a `spice/` directory) and referencing them here.  For example: "Example LTSpice schematics for the half adder and full adder can be found in the `spice/` directory.")**

## Reports and Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains detailed reports and documentation:

*   **`docs/reports/markdown-reports/`:**  Contains Markdown versions of lab reports, providing comprehensive explanations of the adder designs, computer architecture, and implementation details.  These reports are crucial for understanding the project.
*   **`docs/reports/docs/`:** Contains supporting documentation, including LTSpice implementation details for the half adder.
*   **`src/microarch/labs/week3lab3/templates/`:**  Provides templates for report writing and design, including detailed steps for creating and testing a full adder.
*   **`src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/README.md`:** Describes the Full Adder Project, including the Java and C implementations.

## Key Concepts

*   **Hierarchical Design:**  This project demonstrates hierarchical design by building adders from basic gates, and then combining full adders to create multi-bit adders.  See the structure of the `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/` directory, which shows implementations in Java and C, broken down into gates, wires, and circuits.  The reports in `docs/reports/markdown-reports/` also emphasize this hierarchical approach in the design descriptions.

*   **Boolean Algebra and Simplification:** Boolean algebra is fundamental to digital logic design. The reports (e.g., `docs/reports/markdown-reports/report-one.md`) show the derivation of Boolean expressions for adders and mention simplification techniques.

*   **Truth Tables:**  Truth tables are used to formally define the behavior of logic gates and circuits. You can find truth tables for basic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) in the reports, for example in `docs/reports/markdown-reports/report-one.md`.  The code in `src/gates/` also implicitly implements these truth tables in the logic of the gate classes.

*   **Event-Driven Simulation:** The Java and C implementations in `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/` likely use an event-driven simulation approach.  While not explicitly coded as a separate "event queue," the way signals propagate through the circuit and gates react to input changes reflects the principles of event-driven simulation.  Further details on event-driven simulation in digital logic can be found in computer architecture textbooks (see the `docs/references.md` file for suggested resources).

*   **LTSpice Simulation:** LTSpice is a powerful tool for simulating analog and digital circuits. This project uses LTSpice to verify the functionality of the designed digital circuits.  See the "LTSpice Simulation" section above for guidance on using LTSpice with this project.  The reports may also contain discussions of simulation results obtained from LTSpice.

## Notes

*   The `week4` directory appears to be the main working area for this project.  You may have additional files related to your ongoing development within this directory.
*   **(If `week4/` contains specific code or files, describe them here. For example: "The `week4/simulation_scripts/` subdirectory contains Python scripts for automating simulations and data analysis.")**

It is recommended to organize any new files you create within the `week4/` directory into logical subdirectories (e.g., `week4/src/`, `week4/docs/`, `week4/spice/`) to maintain a clean project structure.

## Week 4 Working Directory (`week4/`)

The `week4/` directory appears to be the main working area for this project.  You may have additional files related to your ongoing development within this directory.

**(If `week4/` contains specific code or files, describe them here. For example: "The `week4/simulation_scripts/` subdirectory contains Python scripts for automating simulations and data analysis.")**
{{
The `week4/` directory contains the main working files for the Week 4 lab exercises.  Specifically:

*   `week4/src/`:  Likely contains source code files related to Week 4 tasks.
*   `week4/spice/`:  This directory is intended for LTSpice schematic files (`.asc`) and symbol files (`.asy`) used for simulation.
*   `week4/docs/`:  May contain documentation or notes specific to Week 4.
*   `week4/simulation_scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for automating simulations and data analysis.

}}
It is recommended to organize any new files you create within the `week4/` directory into logical subdirectories (e.g., `week4/src/`, `week4/docs/`, `week4/spice/`) to maintain a clean project structure.

## Future Enhancements and Project Extensions

This project provides a solid foundation for further exploration. Here are some potential extensions:

*   **Implement the Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA):**  The reports discuss the Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) as a more efficient adder architecture than the ripple-carry adder.  A valuable extension would be to implement a 4-bit CLA in Java, C, and LTSpice.  This involves:
    *   **Understanding CLA Logic:** Research the principles of carry lookahead, focusing on generate (G) and propagate (P) signals.
    *   **Design and Implementation:** Derive Boolean equations for a 4-bit CLA and implement it in Java and C, following the modular structure of the existing adder implementations.  Create LTSpice schematics using behavioral sources or gate-level logic to simulate the CLA.
    *   **Testing and Verification:**  Write unit tests (Java, C) and perform LTSpice simulations to thoroughly verify the CLA's functionality.  Compare its performance (especially propagation delay in LTSpice) to the ripple-carry adder.
    *   **Documentation:**  Document your design, implementation, and testing process in your lab reports.

    This enhancement will deepen your understanding of adder architectures and digital design optimization.

*   **Timing Analysis in LTSpice:**  Extend the LTSpice simulations to incorporate realistic gate delays. This would allow you to analyze the propagation delay of the ripple-carry adder and compare it to the theoretical delay.

*   **Develop a Simple Instruction Set Simulator:**  Build a basic simulator (perhaps in Python or Java) that can execute the instruction set described in `docs/reports/docs/lab3a-report-writing-guide.md`. This would allow you to run simple programs on your simulated computer architecture.

*   **Web-Based Full Adder Interface:**  Expand the Java full adder implementation to include a web interface using Spring MVC, as mentioned in `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java/README.md`. This would make the full adder simulation more accessible and interactive.

*   **Explore Different Adder Architectures:**  Research and implement other adder architectures, such as carry-select adders or carry-skip adders, and compare their performance (delay, complexity) to the ripple-carry and carry-lookahead adders.

Choose one of these extensions (or propose your own!).  **A good starting point would be to select one enhancement that interests you and begin with Phase 1: Understanding and Design.**  Good luck!
