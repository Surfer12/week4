# Adder Design Project

This project contains the design and implementation of a Half Adder, Full Adder, and their integration into a simplified computer architecture.

## Directory Structure

- `half_adder/`: Contains the Half Adder design files.
- `full_adder/`: (To be created) Contains the Full Adder design files.
- `cpu_integration/`: (To be created) Will contain the files for integrating the adders into a minimal CPU.
- `lib/`: Contains shared library components, such as LTSpice models.

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory (e.g., `half_adder/`) has its own `README.md` file with specific instructions for that module.
