# Compiler Architecture: From High-Level Code to Hardware Execution

## Introduction
This guide explores how compilers transform high-level programming languages into machine-executable instructions, bridging the gap between software and hardware.

## Key Components of Compiler Architecture

### 1. Frontend Stages
- **Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)**
  - Breaks source code into tokens
  - Identifies individual language elements
  - Example (C-like pseudocode):
    ```c
    // Input: int x = 5 + 3;
    // Tokens: [INT, IDENTIFIER(x), ASSIGNMENT, INTEGER(5), PLUS, INTEGER(3), SEMICOLON]
    ```

### 2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing)
- Builds Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Validates code structure against language grammar
- Transforms tokens into hierarchical representation

### 3. Semantic Analysis
- Type checking
- Semantic consistency verification
- Generates intermediate representation (IR)

### 4. Optimization Stages
- **Local Optimizations**
  - Constant folding
  - Dead code elimination
- **Global Optimizations**
  - Loop transformations
  - Function inlining

### 5. Code Generation
- Translates optimized IR to target machine code
- Handles:
  - Register allocation
  - Instruction selection
  - Architecture-specific optimizations

## Hardware Interaction Principles
- Compilers generate instructions matching CPU instruction set
- Different architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V) require specific code generation
- Compiler must understand:
  - Instruction latency
  - Pipeline characteristics
  - Memory hierarchy

## Performance Considerations
1. Compilation time vs. runtime performance trade-offs
2. Architecture-specific optimizations
3. Instruction-level parallelism

## Modern Compiler Techniques
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
- Profile-guided optimization
- Link-time optimization

## Practical Example: Simple Compilation Workflow
```bash
# Compilation stages
source.c → lexer → parser → semantic analyzer 
→ intermediate representation 
→ optimizer 
→ code generator 
→ machine code
```
