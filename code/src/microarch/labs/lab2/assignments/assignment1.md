The assignment details are identical to those posted on the Week 2 page.

## Key Concepts & Terminology

- **HEX:** Hexadecimal numbering system, used for a compact representation of numbers.
- **2's Complement:** A binary representation method that simplifies handling of positive and negative integers.
- **Truth Tables:** Diagrams showing all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs for logical operations.
- **KMaps (Karnaugh Maps):** Visual tools employed to simplify Boolean expressions by grouping related terms.
- **SOP (Sum of Products):** A canonical form in Boolean logic where individual product terms (AND operations) are summed (OR operation) together.

## Explanation of "Don't Cares"

- **"Don't Cares":**
  - Represent outputs that never occur using an **'X'** in the truth table.
  - When deriving the logic (especially using SOP), you can treat these **'X'** entries as **'0'** to simplify the process.
