Instructor information
My name is Tina Smilkstein. I taught at Cal Poly for many years but left just 2 or 3 years ago. I was a programmer for 10+ years in industry but ended up moving to hardware as I made my way through grad school. My "specialty" is making integrated circuits:

and doing medical technology related projects.

A lot of my work in grad school was in digital systems and computer architecture and, with my programming background, I hope I can give you a great experience this semester.
