# Performance Optimization in C and Mojo

## C Performance Optimization

C provides several techniques for performance optimization:

1. **Memory Management**
   - Manual memory allocation using malloc/free
   - Stack allocation for local variables
   - Memory pooling for frequent allocations

2. **Compiler Optimizations**
   - Use of compiler flags (-O2, -O3)
   - Inline functions with `inline` keyword
   - Loop unrolling

3. **Data Structures**
   - Efficient use of arrays vs linked lists
   - Cache-friendly data layouts
   - Bit fields for compact storage

4. **Algorithm Optimization**
   - Choosing optimal algorithms (O(n) vs O(n^2))
   - Memoization and caching
   - Parallel processing with threads

## Mojo Performance Optimization

Mojo offers modern optimization features:

1. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic memory management with ownership
   - Zero-cost abstractions
   - Built-in memory safety

2. **Compiler Optimizations**
   - Advanced JIT compilation
   - Automatic vectorization
   - SIMD support

3. **Data Structures**
   - Built-in parallel collections
   - Automatic data alignment
   - Cache-aware data structures

4. **Algorithm Optimization**
   - Built-in parallel primitives
   - Automatic loop optimization
   - GPU acceleration support

| Feature                | C                          | Mojo                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Memory Management      | Manual, error-prone        | Automatic, safe           |
| Parallelism            | Requires external libraries| Built-in support          |
| Compiler Optimizations | Basic flags                | Advanced JIT              |
| Safety                 | Manual checks              | Built-in safety           |
| Performance            | High with expertise        | High with less effort     |
| Learning Curve         | Steep                      | Gradual                   |

While C provides fine-grained control for optimization, Mojo offers modern, safer alternatives with comparable performance and easier development.
