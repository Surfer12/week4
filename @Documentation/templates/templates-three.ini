[Notation Key]
GateSymbolNotation = [List of logic gate symbols used in this design]
; e.g., AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), etc., to represent gate operations in Boolean expressions.
WireConnectionSymbols = [Notation for wires and connections in circuit diagrams]
; e.g., lines for connections, a dot for junction, labels/arrows for inputs and outputs.
LogicLevelsRepresentation = [Definition of logic high and low levels]
; e.g., use `1` (HIGH/True) and `0` (LOW/False) to denote binary logic levels.
BooleanExpressionNotation = [Format for writing Boolean formulas]
; e.g., use `+` for OR, `·` or concatenation for AND, overline or `!` for NOT (A + B means A OR B, AB or A·B means A AND B, ¬A means NOT A).

; Justification:  The 'Notation Key' is crucial as it establishes a consistent language for the entire document.  Without a defined notation, ambiguity can arise. This section is directly taken from `notation-template-ini.ini` and `template-bare/template-ini-two.ini`, highlighting its importance in logic documentation.  Consistent notation is a fundamental principle in technical communication and engineering documentation, ensuring clarity and avoiding misinterpretations (IEEE standards for notation are based on this principle).

; e.g., A = Input signal 1, B = Control signal, etc.

; Justification: Defining 'Possible Inputs' is the next logical step after establishing notation. It clearly identifies the inputs to the circuit, their possible values, and their meaning. This section is inspired by `image-template-no-verf-steps.ini` and is essential for understanding the context of the truth table and subsequent analysis.  In system analysis, clearly defining inputs is a prerequisite for understanding system behavior (System Theory principles).

; e.g., Don't-care conditions, specific timing considerations.

; Justification: The 'Truth Table' is a fundamental tool for defining and understanding the behavior of combinational logic circuits. It exhaustively lists all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs, providing a complete functional specification. This section is directly derived from `template-bare/template-ini-two.ini` and `image-template-no-verf-steps.ini`. Truth tables are a cornerstone of Boolean algebra and digital logic design, providing a tabular representation of Boolean functions (Shannon's work on Boolean algebra and circuit design).

; Justification: 'Boolean Expression Reduction' is a crucial step in simplifying logic circuits, leading to more efficient and cost-effective implementations. This section is inspired by `notation-template-ini.ini` and `template-bare/template-ini-two.ini`.

KMapGrouping = [Identify groups of adjacent 1s (or 0s for POS) in the K-map]
; e.g., list groups and common variables.

; e.g., F = ¬A·¬C + B·¬C.

; Justification: 'K-Map Reduction' provides a specific method for Boolean simplification, particularly useful for visual and manual simplification of expressions with a small number of variables. This section is directly inspired by `notation-template-ini.ini` and `template-bare/template-ini-two.ini`. Karnaugh Maps are a widely taught and used method in digital logic design for simplifying Boolean expressions up to 4-5 variables (Karnaugh's original work on K-Maps).

; ✔/❌ Verification:
verify_grouping_complete = (❌) ; All 1-cells (and don't-cares, if any) are correctly covered by groups. (Comment: Ensure groups are of size 1, 2, 4, etc.)

verify_expression_correct = (❌) ; The simplified expression produces the same output as the original truth table. (Comment: Validate using selected test cases.)


[SOP Reduction]
InitialSOP = [Sum-of-Products expression derived from the truth table]

; e.g., factor common terms and simplify using Boolean algebra rules.
ReducedSOP = [Final minimized SOP expression]
; e.g., F = A·B + ¬C·B.

; Justification: 'SOP Reduction' offers an algebraic approach to Boolean simplification, providing an alternative or complementary method to K-Maps. This section is inspired by `notation-template-ini.ini` and `template-bare/template-ini-two.ini`.  Sum-of-Products is a standard canonical form in Boolean algebra, and algebraic manipulation is a fundamental skill in logic simplification (Boolean algebra laws and theorems).

; ✔/❌ Verification:

verify_algebraic_steps = (❌) ; Each simplification step follows Boolean algebra rules accurately. (Comment: Review reduction steps carefully.)
verify_sop_matches_kmap = (❌) ; The reduced SOP is equivalent to the K-map derived expression. (Comment: Both methods must yield the same result.)


[Gate Operations]
Gate1 = [Gate type and inputs -> output]
; e.g., G1: AND gate with inputs A and B, output X.
Gate2 = [Gate type and inputs -> output]
; e.g., G2: NOT gate with input C, output Y.
Gate3 = [Gate type and inputs -> output]
; e.g., G3: OR gate with inputs X and Y, output F.

; Justification: 'Gate Operations' describes the actual implementation of the logic circuit using logic gates. This section bridges the gap between the simplified Boolean expression and the physical circuit.  Inspired by `notation-template-ini.ini` and `template-bare/template-ini-two.ini`.
