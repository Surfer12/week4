Based on the content of the week4 folder, here are the suggested next steps organized by priority:

1. Lab 2 Implementation Focus:
   - The presence of `half_adder` implementation and various lab2 materials suggests this is a key focus
   - You have presentations and documentation in `/week4/docs/presentations/` specifically about gates and adders (Topic4_AddersAndMultipliersToPost.pptx)

2. Practical Implementation Steps:
```
a. Complete Half Adder Testing:
   - Use the files in /week4/half_adder/
   - Test using LTSpice with the netlists provided in sim/ltspice/
   - Verify against verification checklist in half_adder_verification.md

b. Move to Full Adder:
   - Empty full_adder/ directory exists - needs implementation
   - Use similar structure as half_adder/
   - Reference Topic4_AddersAndMultipliersToPost.pptx for guidance

c. Logic Library Integration:
   - Multiple versions of LogicLibrary.zip exist
   - Choose correct version from /week4/src/logic-library/
   - Contains necessary components: ANDx, ORx, NAND, etc.
```

3. Documentation & Report:
```
- Use templates in /week4/docs/reports/templates/
- Reference lab report examples in /week4/docs/reports/pdf-documents/
- Follow verification steps in half_adder_verification.md
```

4. Advanced Topics to Consider:
```
a. CLA (Carry Look-ahead Adder):
   - Files exist: /week4/@/cla_4bit.v
   - Supporting documentation in /week4/docs/presentations/

b. Integration with CPU:
   - Directory structure suggests future CPU integration
   - Resources available in /week4/src/microarch/
```

5. Resources Available:
```
- Lab materials: /week4/labs/lab2/
- Homework reference: /week4/homework/week2/
- Presentations: /week4/docs/presentations/
- Logic Library components: /week4/src/logic-library/
```

Would you like me to help you focus on any of these specific areas? I can:

1. Help set up and test the half adder implementation
2. Guide you through starting the full adder implementation
3. Assist with documentation and report writing
4. Help with Logic Library integration
5. Support advanced topics like CLA implementation

Which area would you like to focus on first?
