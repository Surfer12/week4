# Microarchitecture Course Project: Adder Design and Computer Architecture

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase, documentation, and supporting materials for a microarchitecture course project. The project focuses on the design, implementation, and simulation of digital adders (half adder, full adder, and ripple-carry adder) and their integration into a simplified computer architecture.  The project emphasizes a hierarchical design approach, starting from basic logic gates and building up to more complex systems.  It covers both theoretical concepts (Boolean algebra, truth tables) and practical implementation using Java, C, and LTSpice.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into the following directories:

## Components

### 1. Adders

This project explores several adder designs:

*   **Half Adder:** The fundamental building block, adding two single-bit inputs (A, B) and producing a sum (S) and carry-out (Cout).
    *   Boolean Equations:
        *   `Sum = A XOR B`
        *   `Carry = A AND B`
    *   Implementation: See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/` (Java and C), and `docs/reports/docs/hardware-half-adder-implementation.txt` for LTSpice details.
*   **Full Adder:** Extends the half adder by including a carry-in (Cin) input, allowing for the chaining of adders.
    *   Boolean Equations:
        *   `Sum = (A XOR B) XOR Cin`
        *   `Carry = (A AND B) OR (Cin AND (A XOR B))`
    *   Implementation: See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/` (Java and C), and `docs/reports/markdown-reports/report-one.md` for a detailed report.
*   **Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA):**  A multi-bit adder created by chaining multiple full adders together.  The carry-out of each full adder becomes the carry-in of the next.
    *   Implementation:  Conceptual design in `src/microarch/labs/lab2/overview/lab2_overview.md` and `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/README.md`.
*    **Carry Lookahead Adder:** Described in the reports, but not fully implemented in code.

### 2. Simplified Computer Architecture

The project also includes a simplified computer architecture that incorporates the adder within an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Key components include:

*   **ALU:** Performs arithmetic (addition/subtraction) and logical operations.  Uses a 4-bit Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA) for addition.
*   **Register File:**  Provides temporary storage for operands and results.
*   **Instruction Memory (ROM):** Stores the program instructions.
*   **Data Memory (SRAM):** Stores data operands.
*   **Control Unit:** Decodes instructions and generates control signals to orchestrate data flow.

    *   See `docs/reports/markdown-reports/report-one.md`, `docs/reports/docs/lab3a-report-writing-guide.md`, and `docs/reports/markdown-reports/updated.md` for detailed descriptions of the architecture.

## Implementation Languages

*   **Java:** Used for a modular, object-oriented implementation of the full adder, including event-driven simulation and unit testing.  (See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java/`)
*   **C:**  Provides a lower-level implementation of the full adder, demonstrating gate-level logic. (See `src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/c/`)
*   **LTSpice:** Used for circuit simulation and verification.  Netlists and subcircuit definitions are discussed in various reports and templates. (See `src/microarch/labs/week3lab3/templates/`, `docs/reports/docs/hardware-half-adder-implementation.txt`)

## Build and Run Instructions

### Java Full Adder

1.  **Prerequisites:** Java 8+ and Gradle.
2.  **Navigate:**  `cd src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java/`
3.  **Build:** `./gradlew build`
4.  **Run:** `./gradlew run`
5.  **Test:** `./gradlew test`

### C Full Adder

1.  **Navigate:** `cd src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/c/`
2.  **Build:** `make`
3.  **Run:** `./fulladder`
4.  **Clean:** `make clean`

### LTSpice

*   LTSpice simulations are primarily documented through reports and templates.  You'll need to create `.asc` (schematic) and `.asy` (symbol) files based on the designs described.
*   Refer to `src/microarch/labs/week3lab3/templates/full-adder-design-template.md` for guidance on creating LTSpice simulations of logic gates.

## Reports and Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains detailed reports and documentation:

*   **`docs/reports/markdown-reports/`:**  Contains Markdown versions of lab reports, providing comprehensive explanations of the adder designs, computer architecture, and implementation details.  These reports are crucial for understanding the project.
*   **`docs/reports/docs/`:** Contains supporting documentation, including LTSpice implementation details for the half adder.
*   **`src/microarch/labs/week3lab3/templates/`:**  Provides templates for report writing and design, including detailed steps for creating and testing a full adder.
*   **`src/conversions/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/README.md`:** Describes the Full Adder Project, including the Java and C implementations.

## Key Concepts

*   **Hierarchical Design:** The project emphasizes building complex systems from smaller, well-defined modules (e.g., building a full adder from gates, and a ripple-carry adder from full adders).
*   **Boolean Algebra and Simplification:**  Understanding Boolean algebra is essential for deriving and simplifying the logic equations for the adders.  Techniques like Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps) are mentioned in the templates.
*   **Truth Tables:**  Truth tables are used extensively for verifying the correctness of the adder designs.
*   **Event-Driven Simulation:** The Java implementation uses an event-driven approach to simulate the behavior of the circuit.
*   **LTSpice Simulation:** LTSpice is used for analog circuit simulation, but can be adapted to simulate digital logic using behavioral sources or transistor-level implementations of gates.

## Notes

*   The `week4` directory appears to be your primary working directory.  You should organize any additional files within this directory into the appropriate `src` or `docs` subdirectories.
*   The project mentions potential extensions, such as database integration and a web interface for the Java full adder. These are not yet implemented.
*   The reports discuss a Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA), but the codebase does not appear to contain a full implementation of the CLA. The reports describe its integration into the ALU conceptually.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of your microarchitecture project. It should serve as a valuable resource for anyone reviewing or working with your codebase. Remember to update the placeholder sections (presentations and images) with your actual files.
