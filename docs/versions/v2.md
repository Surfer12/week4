# Half Adder & CPU Integration – Revised Documentation

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the design and analysis of a Half Adder, culminating in a brief look at its role within a minimal CPU architecture. It applies standard digital electronics practices—covering notation, Boolean simplification, gate-level schematics, simulation, and verification.

The primary objectives are:

- Clearly define inputs, outputs, and internal signals for a Half Adder.
- Demonstrate step-by-step K-Map and SOP (Sum of Products) simplifications.
- Present gate-level implementations, including timing considerations.
- Showcase a structured verification approach through simulation and checklists.
- Illustrate how the Half Adder concept extends to multi-bit adders and simple CPU designs.

## 3. Notation & Definitions
**Boolean Algebra Conventions**
- **Constants:** 1 (HIGH/True), 0 (LOW/False)
- **Operators:** `+` for OR, `·` or juxtaposition for AND, `¬` or `'` for NOT
- **XOR:** Represented by `⊕`. For instance, `A ⊕ B = A'B + AB'`

**Gate Symbols**
- **AND Gate** – Output is 1 only if all inputs are 1.
- **OR Gate** – Output is 1 if at least one input is 1.
- **NOT Gate** – Inverts the input (output is 1 if input is 0).
- **NAND Gate** – NOT of AND.
- **NOR Gate** – NOT of OR.
- **XOR Gate** – Output is 1 if inputs differ.

## 4. Inputs & Truth Table
The Half Adder has two 1-bit inputs, **A** and **B**, producing two outputs:
- **Sum**: The least significant result bit.
- **Carry**: A bit that indicates overflow into the next significance.

### 4.1 Truth Table

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
|:-:|:-:|:---:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |

From the truth table, we see:
- `Sum = A ⊕ B`  
- `Carry = A · B`

## 5. K-Map & SOP Reductions

### 5.1 K-Map for Sum
Using two variables A, B:

|    | B=0 | B=1 |
|:--:|:---:|:---:|
|**A=0**|  0  |  1  |
|**A=1**|  1  |  0  |

This simplifies directly to `Sum = A'B + AB'` (i.e., exclusive OR).

### 5.2 K-Map for Carry

|    | B=0 | B=1 |
|:--:|:---:|:---:|
|**A=0**|  0  |  0  |
|**A=1**|  0  |  1  |

Only one minterm at (A=1, B=1), giving `Carry = A · B`.

### 5.3 SOP Representation
- **Sum**: `Sum = A'B + AB'`
- **Carry**: `Carry = A · B`

---

## 6. Gate-Level Implementation

Each simplified Boolean expression can be directly translated into gates:

1. **Sum** (`A'B + AB'`)
   - Invert A to make A', invert B to make B'.
   - AND gate for `(A' · B)`, another AND gate for `(A · B')`.
   - OR gate merges these two AND outputs to create `Sum`.

2. **Carry** (`A · B`)
   - Single AND gate with inputs A and B.

### 6.1 Timing Considerations
- If using basic gates (INVERT, AND, OR), the path for **Sum** can be:  
  *(Inverter delay)* + *(AND delay)* + *(OR delay)*.
- The **Carry** path is typically just an AND gate, so it may be faster.

An example partial netlist (for a standard logic simulator) might look like:

```
* HALF ADDER Netlist (Basic)
XU1 A vdd 0 A_INV INVERT  ; A'
XU2 B vdd 0 B_INV INVERT  ; B'
XU3 A_INV B vdd 0 N1 ANDx ; A'·B
XU4 A B_INV vdd 0 N2 ANDx ; A·B'
XU5 N1 N2 vdd 0 SUM ORx   ; (A'B + AB')
XU6 A B vdd 0 CARRY ANDx  ; (A·B)
Vdd vdd 0 5V
.tran 100n
.end
```

## 7. Simulation & Verification

### 7.1 Simulation Setup
1. **Tool Selection**: Use a general-purpose Spice-based simulator (e.g., LTSpice, Multisim) or a digital simulator.
2. **Input Stimuli**: Toggle A and B through all combinations at 20 ns intervals:
   - 0→1 transitions at 20 ns, 40 ns, etc., to cover all four input states.
3. **Measurement**: Observe `Sum` and `Carry` waveforms. Confirm they match the truth table.

### 7.2 Sample Waveform Analysis
|
Time (ns)| A | B | Sum | Carry | Comments
---------|---|---|-----|-------|---------------------------------------------------
0–20     | 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   | Initial state
20–40    | 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   | A transitions high
40–60    | 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   | B transitions high → carry = 1
60–80    | 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   | A returns low
80–100   | 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   | B returns low

### 7.3 Verification Checklist
- **Truth Table Consistency**: Verify Sum and Carry are correct for each A,B combo.
- **Timing Integrity**: No unexpected glitches or partial transitions.
- **Gate Delays**: Sum path vs. Carry path meet project constraints.

If all checks pass, the design is considered valid.

## 8. CPU Integration Overview

While the Half Adder itself is small, it forms the foundation for multi-bit adders and can integrate into a larger CPU design. For instance:

1. **Ripple-Carry Adder**: Four instances of this half-adder architecture plus a carry chain create a 4-bit or 8-bit adder.
2. **Full Adder Expansion**: A half adder can be extended with an additional carry-in path to form a full adder block.
3. **Minimal CPU**: In a simple CPU architecture, the adder is integral to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Basic instructions like ADD, SUB, or LOAD/STORE rely on the adder for correct arithmetic.

**Example Flow**:
- **Instruction Fetch** → decode ADD → *invoke the ALU’s adder logic* → store result in a register or memory.

## 9. Conclusion
This revised documentation emphasizes clarity, modular sections, and a well-defined verification process. By:

- Introducing a short overview and Table of Contents.
- Presenting well-labeled sections spanning theory, implementation, and simulation.
- Summarizing checks with simple verification steps.

… we achieve a more concise, maintainable format. The Half Adder example here can easily scale to full adders or integrated CPU systems.
