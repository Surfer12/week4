Here's a distinct reference sheet for `analysis-of-samples.md` and `breakdown.md` incorporating the codebase:

### Reference Sheet for `analysis-of-samples.md` and `breakdown.md`

**1. Common Elements and Best Practices:**

- **Version 4:** All `.asc` files should start with `Version 4` or `Version 4.1` for LTspice compatibility.
- **SHEET 1 <width> <height>:** Defines the schematic sheet dimensions. Adjust as needed.
- **Component Definitions:**
  - `SYMBOL <type> <x> <y> <rotation>`: Places a component symbol. Ensure corresponding `.asy` files exist.
  - `SYMATTR InstName <name>`: Assigns a unique instance name for netlisting and simulation.
  - `SYMATTR Value <value>`: Sets the component's value or model name.
  - `SYMATTR SpiceLine <parameters>`: Adds extra Spice parameters for complex components.
  - `WINDOW ...`: Controls how values are displayed on the schematic.
- **Wiring:**
  - `WIRE <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>`: Connects components.
  - `LINE Normal <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> <style>`: Draws lines for visual separation or custom symbols.
- **Text and Comments:**
  - `TEXT <x> <y> <alignment> <size> <text>`: Adds text for comments, Spice directives, or labels.
- **Spice Models:**
  - `.model <name> <type> (<parameters>)`: Defines Spice models for components.
- **Include Directives:**
  - `.lib <filename>` or `.inc <filename>` or `.include <filename>`: Includes external files for models or subcircuits.
- **Plot Settings (.plt files):** Accompany `.asc` files to define plot settings for simulation results.

**2. Template for `.asc` Files:**

**3. Applying the Template to `week4micrototal` and `LogicLibraryAlt`:**

- **LogicLibraryAlt:**
  - Ensure consistency in file structure and component definitions.
  - Use subcircuits for modularity and reusability.
  - Address missing `.asy` files for subcircuits.
  - Consolidate models into a single `.lib` or `.txt` file.
  - Enhance comments for better understanding.
  - Include testbenches for each component.
  - Add `.op` and `.measure` directives for detailed analysis.
  - Ensure `Computer.asc` has detailed comments explaining the architecture.

- **week4micrototal:**
  - Create `.asc` files implementing the described computer architecture.
  - Leverage components from `LogicLibraryAlt` using `.include`.
  - Create testbenches for each component and the overall system.
  - Update documentation to reflect design and implementation details.
  - Utilize `LogicLibraryAlt/new-circuits` components as building blocks.
  - Create or locate `RegisterFile.asc` if needed.

**4. Computer Architecture Breakdown:**

- **Data Width:** 4-bit for ALU, registers, and memory.
- **Instruction Width:** 8-bit.
- **Instruction Memory:** ROM-based with 256 locations.
- **Data Memory:** SRAM-based with 4 locations.
- **Register File:** 4-bit.

**5. Component Details:**

- **ALU:** 4-bit, includes `AddSub1` unit, input multiplexers, and status flags.
- **Register File:** Uses D flip-flops for data storage.
- **Instruction Memory:** ROM-based, fixed program post-manufacture.
- **Data Memory:** SRAM-based, 4 locations, 4-bit data width.
- **Control Logic:** Implicit in `Computer.asc`, likely implemented with logic gates and possibly a state machine.
- **Clock System:** Single-clock domain, synchronous operation.

**6. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):**

- **ADD:** `00 Dest[2:0] X Src[1:0]` - Add two registers.
- **SUB:** `01 Dest[2:0] X Src[1:0]` - Subtract two registers.
- **LOAD:** `11 Reg[2:0] X Addr[1:0]` - Load from memory to register.
- **STORE:** `10 Reg[2:0] X Addr[1:0]` - Store register to memory.

**7. Data Path and Control Flow:**

- Single-cycle design where each instruction completes in one clock cycle.

**8. Performance Characteristics:**

- Limited by the slowest component in the critical path.
- Single-cycle design simplifies control but limits clock speed.

**9. Output Generation Guidance:**

- Address discrepancies between markdown and codebase.
- Clarify instruction formats.
- Include specifics of `RegisterFile.asc` once available.
- Describe control signals and operations.
- Add a block diagram for component interconnections.

**10. Examples:**

- Include more examples demonstrating different instructions and addressing modes.

**11. Notes and Clarifications:**

- ROM for instruction memory implies fixed programs.
- Small data memory size limits program complexity.
- Single-cycle design is simple but not necessarily efficient in terms of performance.

This reference sheet provides a comprehensive guide for organizing and improving LTspice projects, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and well-documented circuits. Remember to save backups frequently and use version control (like Git) to track changes.
