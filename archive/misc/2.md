1. **Propositional Logic Template**

**Propositional Logic Statement:**

A proposition is a statement that can be either true (T) or false (F).

- **Example:** "The sky is blue." (True)
- **Example:** "2 + 2 = 5." (False)

**Logical Connectives:**

- **AND (Conjunction, ∧):** Both propositions must be true.
  
  *Example:* "(It is raining) ∧ (It is cold)" is true only if both conditions are met.

- **OR (Disjunction, ∨):** At least one proposition must be true.
  
  *Example:* "(It is raining)∨ (It is sunny)" is true if either condition is met.

- **NOT (Negation, ¬):** Inverts the truth value.
  
  *Example:* "¬(It is raining)" ⇒ "It is not raining."

- **Implication (→):** "If P then Q"; if the first proposition is true, then the second must be true.
  
  *Example:* "(Rain) → (Wet Ground)."

- **Biconditional (↔):** Both propositions have the same truth value.
  
  *Example:* "(Rain) ↔ (Wet Ground)" means both true or both false.

**Truth Table for Logical Connectives:**

| P | Q | P ∧ Q | P ∨ Q | ¬P | P → Q | P ↔ Q |
|---|---|-------|-------|----|-------|-------|
| T | T | T     | T     | F  | T     | T     |
| T | F | F     | T     | F  | F     | F     |
| F | T | F     | T     | T  | T     | F     |
| F | F | F     | F     | T  | T     | T     |

2. **Predicate Logic Template**

**Predicate Logic Statement:**

A predicate is a function that returns true or false for given inputs.

- **Example:** P(x): "x is greater than 5."

**Quantifiers:**

- **Universal Quantifier (∀):** "For all x, P(x) is true."
  
  *E.g.,* ∀x (x > 0 → x² > 0)

- **Existential Quantifier (∃):** "There exists an x such that P(x)."
  
  *E.g.,* ∃x (x is even ∧ x is prime)

**Template for Writing Predicate Logic Statements:**

- **Predicate:** P(x) = "x is [condition]"

- **Statement:** ∀x ∈ [Domain], P(x) [logical connective] Q(x)
  
  *Example:* ∀x ∈ ℕ, (x > 2 → x² > 4)

- **Statement:** ∃x ∈ [Domain] such that P(x)
  
  *Example:* ∃x ∈ ℤ, x² = 4

3. **Proof Techniques Template**

**Direct Proof**

- **Statement:** If P, then Q (P → Q)

- **Steps:**
  1. Assume P is true.
  2. Use logical steps to show Q must be true.

**Proof by Contradiction**

- **Statement:** Prove P.

- **Steps:**
  1. Assume ¬P (the negation).
  2. Show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.
  3. Conclude P must be true.

**Proof by Induction**

- **Statement:** Prove P(n) is true for all n ≥ k (often k=0 or 1).

- **Steps:**
  1. **Base Case:** Prove P(k) is true.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume P(n) is true for n = m (Inductive Hypothesis).
     - Prove P(m+1) is true using that hypothesis.

**Template for Proof by Induction**

- **Base Case:** Show P(k) holds.
  
  *Example:* Prove P(0) is true.

- **Inductive Step:**
  1. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume P(n) is true for n = m.
  2. **Inductive Proof:** Show P(m+1) is true using the hypothesis.

4. **Recursively Defined Functions**

**Definition of a Recursive Function:**
A function defined in terms of one or more simpler or smaller instances of itself. It has:

- **Base Case(s):** Explicit definition without recursion.
- **Recursive Case(s):** The function calls itself on smaller inputs.

**General Form (Example: Factorial):**

**Example:** Fibonacci Sequence

**Tips:**

- Identify a clear base case or cases.
- Express the recursive step so it moves toward the base.
- Use Proof by Induction to establish properties.

5. **Set Theory, Relations, and Counting/Combinatorics**

**5.1 Basic Set Theory**

- **Set Notation:** e.g., A = {1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Subset (⊆):** A ⊆ B means every element of A is also in B.
- **Union (A ∪ B)** and **Intersection (A ∩ B):** Combine or overlap sets.
- **Complement (A^c):** Elements not in A.

**5.2 Relations**

A relation R between sets A and B is a subset of A × B.

**Common properties on a set A:**

- **Reflexive:** ∀x ∈ A, (x, x) ∈ R.
- **Symmetric:** ∀x, y ∈ A, (x, y) ∈ R ⇒ (y, x) ∈ R.
- **Transitive:** ∀x, y, z ∈ A, (x, y) ∈ R and (y, z) ∈ R ⇒ (x, z) ∈ R.

If R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then R is an equivalence relation (see Section 7).

**5.3 Counting and Combinatorics**

**Basic Counting Principles:**

- **Addition Principle:** If event A can occur in m ways and event B in n ways (disjoint), then A ∪ B can occur in m + n ways.
- **Multiplication Principle:** If event A can occur in m ways and event B in n ways (sequential), then the combination occurs in m × n ways.

**Permutations and Combinations:**

- **Permutation:** Number of ways to order k items from n distinct items: P(n, k) = n! / (n − k)!
- **Combination:** Number of ways to choose k items from n (order doesn't matter): C(n, k) = n! / [k! (n − k)!]

**Binomial Theorem**

**Tips:**

- Proof by Induction often applies in combinatorial identities.
- Count carefully by breaking down into simpler elements.

6. **Recurrence Relations**

A recurrence relation defines a sequence {a_n} where each term depends on previous terms.

**General Form:**

**Common Examples:**

- **Arithmetic Recurrence:** a_n = a_{n−1} + d.
- **Geometric Recurrence:** a_n = r · a_{n−1}.
- **Fibonacci-like:** F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}, base cases F₀, F₁.

**6.1 Solving Recurrence Relations**

- **Iteration (Unrolling):** Expand terms until a pattern emerges.
- **Characteristic Equation (for linear homogeneous recurrences):**
  
  *e.g.,* a_n = c₁ a_{n−1} + c₂ a_{n−2}.
  
  Solve r² − c₁ r − c₂ = 0.

- **Master Theorem:** For recurrences like T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n).
- **Generating Functions:** Convert to a power series.
- **Proof by Induction:** Once a form is hypothesized, prove it.

7. **Equivalence Relations & Equivalence Classes**

**7.1 Equivalence Relations**

A relation R on set A is an equivalence relation if it is:

- **Reflexive:** ∀a ∈ A, (a, a) ∈ R.
- **Symmetric:** (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R.
- **Transitive:** (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R.

**7.2 Equivalence Classes**

The equivalence class of a ∈ A is the set of all elements related to a:

- Each element belongs to exactly one equivalence class.

**7.3 Applying Set Theory to Equivalence**

Equivalence relations partition a set into disjoint classes.

**Example:** Congruence mod m: a ≡ b (mod m) if m | (a − b).

All integers with the same remainder mod m form an equivalence class.

**Tips:**

- Check reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity.
- Equivalence classes are crucial for grouping objects.

**Integrating These Templates**

- **Logic Tools (1–2):** Formalize statements about sets, functions, or relations.
- **Proof Techniques (3):** Used to prove properties of recursive functions, recurrence solutions, combinatorial claims.
- **Recursively Defined Functions (4)** & **Recurrence Relations (6):** Often rely on induction.
- **Set Theory & Relations (5)** plus **Equivalence Relations (7):** Foundational language for analyzing complex structures.

These expansions form a cohesive “Discrete Math Canvas,” covering fundamental language and methods from basic counting to complex equivalence class proofs.
