* FullAdder_Test.asc - Testbench for the Full Adder circuit

* Include the full adder definition (adjust path as necessary)
.INCLUDE ./FullAdder.asc

* Voltage sources to stimulate the inputs with PULSE definitions.
V_A A 0 PULSE(0 5 0 1n 1n 10n 20n)
V_B B 0 PULSE(0 5 0 1n 1n 20n 40n)
V_Cin Cin 0 PULSE(0 5 0 1n 1n 30n 60n)

* Simulation Directive: Run a transient analysis
.tran 0 100n

* Control section for LTspice to run the simulation and plot the outputs.
