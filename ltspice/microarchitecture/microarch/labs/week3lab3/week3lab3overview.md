Initial Assessment {{summary, integration}}
----------------------------------
Below is a summary of Week 3’s lab and lecture activities as they build upon the previous weeks’ work and prepare you for upcoming assignments:

Contextual Overview
-------------------
• Week 3 focuses on finishing the design of the ALU, registers, memory, and assembling a complete computer block diagram. This builds on Week 2, which covered numbers, data, gates, truth tables, and other essential digital circuit design aspects using LTSpice.

Monday 2/3 – ALU, K-Maps, and Adder Enhancements
-------------------------------------------------
1. Homework & Prep:
   - Complete last week’s homework, emphasizing the derivation of logic from truth tables.
   - Familiarize yourself with Karnaugh Maps (KMaps) as they simplify logic equations; fewer gates mean faster and more power-efficient circuits.
   - (Optional Reading) Review the KMaps chapter from this resource: [Lab-3_-Boolean-Algebra-and-K-Maps.pdf](https://rhlab.ece.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/03/Lab-3_-Boolean-Algebra-and-K-Maps.pdf).

2. In-Class Lecture:
   - Introduction to KMaps, highlighting their importance in reducing logic expressions for more efficient circuit design.

3. Lab Session Tasks:
   - Design a more complex block as outlined in the adder lab handout:
     • Create the comprehensive truth table.
     • Apply KMap techniques to reduce the logic.
     • Enter the reduced logic circuit into LTSpice.
     • Create a corresponding block symbol.
     • Test the circuit functionality.
   - Cascade the newly designed block with the one from Week 2 to build a 4-bit adder:
     • Create a symbol for the full adder.
     • Test the cascaded design.
   - Use provided resources such as:
     • Lab handout (Lab for week 3 – Monday).
     • Files like EightInputsForAdderTest.txt to simulate the circuit (cycle through all possible input values over 128m).

4. Deliverables:
   - Add the lab work to your report. Additional details and modifications may be incorporated during Wednesday’s session.

Wednesday 2/5 – Registers, Memory, and the Computer Block Diagram
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Lecture Focus:
   - Dive into registers and memory:
     • Understand that a register is a group of flip-flops (each storing 1 bit).
     • Recognize that registers (or the register file) are used for fast access data storage (e.g., for the ALU) while RAM is used for larger, less immediate data storage.
   - Review supplementary materials:
     • D flip-flops discussion (watch the recommended YouTube video on D flip-flops).
     • Memory operation insights (another video resource).
   - Lecture slides on registers and memory (refer to L3_RegistersAndMemory.pptx).

2. In-Class Lab:
   - Work collaboratively to complete the overall computer block diagram.
     • Integrate the ALU with registers and memory.
     • Add the register file to the ALU, demonstrating how data flows between registers and RAM.
   - This design will be critical for understanding midterm concepts.

3. Deliverables:
   - Incorporate this week’s lab work and the complete computer block diagram into your report.
   - There’s no immediate lab submission on 2/5, but attendance is strongly encouraged due to its importance.

Next Steps & Upcoming Week 4
-----------------------------
• The lab moves toward finishing the hardware design and linking it with assembly/machine language concepts in Week 4 (2/10, 2/12).
• Continue building on the logical design and simulation skills developed during Weeks 2 and 3.

Summary
-------
Week 3 is a pivotal week where you:
- Transition from basic gate and truth table experiments (Week 2) to more complex circuit designs using KMaps for ALU enhancements.
- Extend your lab work by cascading blocks to form a 4-bit adder.
- Learn about registers and memory, with an in-depth look at how these components integrate with the ALU in a complete computer system.
- Work on a comprehensive computer block diagram that ties together all elements, which is especially important for your midterm.

Meta-Reflection
---------------
This summary ties together the preparatory homework, essential lecture notes, lab steps for designing efficient logic using KMaps, and the integration of registers and memory into a full computer diagram. The detailed breakdown should assist in both your lab report compilation and in preparing for upcoming lectures and assignments.
