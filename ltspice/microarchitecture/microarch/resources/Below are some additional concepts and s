These outlines not only provide structure but also include "Starting Sentence" guidance to help create a narrative for each section. By incorporating checklists, tips, placeholders for simulation screenshots, and additional resource references, you can streamline the process and ensure all relevant details are addressed in your lab reports and homework assignments.

If you'd like, I can update or create corresponding Markdown files with these outlines to serve as templates for future labs and assignments. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with that!
