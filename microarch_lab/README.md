## Additional Lab Resources

The Microarchitecture Learning Lab integrates several detailed lab exercises and supplementary resources to enhance your learning experience. Below are some key resources and updates:

- **Lab 2: Building with Gates**: Detailed instructions and documentation are available in:
  - [Lab Two Building with Gates](resources/Lab%20Two%20Building%20with%20Gates.md)
  - [Lab Two Building with Gates - Alternative Version](resources/Lab%20Two%20Building%20with%20Gates-2.md)

- **Additional Concepts**: For outlines and ideas on future lab assignments (e.g., digital sequential design, Boolean minimization, and timing analysis), see [Below are some additional concepts](resources/Below%20are%20some%20additional%20concepts.md).

- **Spice Schematics & Static Diagrams**: The lab2schematixspice folder and interactive simulators now offer a "Static Diagram Example" option, providing a visual guide for circuit designs. Select this option from the simulator menu for an overview of key circuits.

- **Documentation & File Management**: Refer to the 'after-directions' summary for insights into file generation, session logging, and overall documentation practices.

These resources are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of materials that connect practical lab work with conceptual outlines and tools for advanced circuit visualization.
