Digital Design Best Practices Summary:
  1. Begin with a comprehensive truth table that captures all input combinations and their outputs.
  2. Leverage Karnaugh Maps (K-maps) with Gray code ordering to simplify and validate Boolean expressions.
  3. Adapt the computational state into Python for effective simulation and further analysis.
Follow these guidelines to design, analyze, and validate digital circuits accurately.

Truth Table:
This section provides a detailed, structured view of each bit's logic state and its Gray code conversion.
It is essential for verifying digital logic computations. For example, observe how a bit's value is mapped to its Gray code equivalent.
Index      Bit        Gray
0          -          -
1          1          1
2          0          0
3          0          0
4          1          1

K-Map Representation:
The Karnaugh Map (K-Map) aids in simplifying Boolean expressions by visually grouping adjacent bits.
This grouping helps to optimize digital designs by identifying common factors and minimizing logic complexity.
x2_0: [0, 0, 0, 0]
x2_1: [0, 0, 0, 0]

Adapted State:
The Adapted State bridges the raw digital computations and their representation in Python.
It translates the computational process into a structured mapping. For example, a key 'x2_0' with value [1, 0, 0, 0] confirms successful adaptation.
Key        Value
x2_0       [0, 0, 0, 0]
x2_1       [0, 0, 0, 0]
