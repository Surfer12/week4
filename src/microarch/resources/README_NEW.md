# Multidisciplinary Analysis of Prompts

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive exploration of multidisciplinary analysis applied to prompt engineering and AI-driven text analysis. It integrates modern AI technologies, including the Anthropic API, to perform code analysis, documentation enhancement, and prompt evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Anthropic API Integration:** Leverages the Anthropic API for detailed code analysis, improvements, and documentation enhancements.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organized with a clear separation between source code (`src/`), tests (`tests/`), documentation (`docs/`), and utilities (`utils/`).
- **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Combines traditional code review techniques with AI-driven analysis to improve performance, readability, and security.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Contains the primary source code, including modules such as the Anthropic tool (`src/tools/anthropic_tool.py`).
- **tests/**: Automated testing of the project's components.
- **docs/**: Documentation, guides, and additional project resources.
- **config/**: Configuration files and environment setup.
- Other directories support examples, utilities, and additional functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure environment variables by copying the example file:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   and modify as needed.

## Usage

- **Code Analysis:** Utilize the tools in `src/tools/anthropic_tool.py` to analyze your code for general, performance, readability, and security aspects.
- **Documentation Enhancement:** Generate improved code documentation using integrated functions.
- **Running Tests:** Execute tests with:
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```

## Analysis

This repository embodies a multidisciplinary perspective by fusing classical analysis with state-of-the-art AI methods. The integration with the Anthropic API enables dynamic analysis of codeâ€”offering insights, pinpointing inefficiencies, and suggesting improvements. The modular design further encourages customization and scalability, making it a robust tool for prompt and code analysis.
