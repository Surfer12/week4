Below is a suggested structured format for your Lab Two write-up. You can adapt the headers, numbering, and details as needed. The important part is to clearly present each required step (from understanding the problem, to creating truth tables, to simulation and integration) and provide all relevant screenshots, schematics, and files.

# Lab Two: Building with Gates

**Submission Date:** Monday, 2/3

# 1. Introduction

*   **Objective**
    Briefly state the purpose of this lab. For example:
    > “The objective of this lab is to design, simulate, and test a simple block with carry-in = 0 (using logical gates in LTSpice) and then optimize the design for a Least Significant Bit (LSB) block without a carry-in input.”
*   **Overview**
    Give a high-level overview of what will be done in Parts 1 and 2.
    > “Part 1 focuses on designing and verifying a single-bit adder block with carry-in set to zero. Part 2 extends the design by creating a simplified LSB block that eliminates the carry-in entirely.”

# 2. Part 1: Main Block Design (Carry-In = 0)

## 2.1 Understand the Problem

*   Provide a brief description of the role of the block and why setting the carry-in to 0 simplifies the logic.

## 2.2 Create Truth Tables

*   **SUM Table:** Include the input variables (e.g., A, B, Cin=0) and the resulting SUM.
*   **CARRY-OUT Table:** Same inputs, now focusing on the CARRY-OUT bit.

    **Example Layout**

    (Fill in the question marks with the correct outputs.)

## 2.3 Derive the Logic (SOP)

*   Show each Sum of Products step for the SUM output and for the CARRY-OUT output.
*   Write down the final Boolean expressions for both outputs.

## 2.4 Enter the Circuits into LTSpice

*   Explain how you translated the Boolean expressions into LTSpice schematic form.
*   Mention any specific gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, XOR) used.

## 2.5 Create a Symbol for the Block

*   Show or describe how you created the symbol (.asy file) in LTSpice.
*   Optionally include a screenshot of the symbol.

## 2.6 Develop a New Schematic to Test the Block

*   Show the top-level schematic you used to test all possible input combinations.
*   Briefly describe how the inputs are driven (e.g., using voltage sources, pulse sources, etc.).

## 2.7 Simulation and Results

*   **Simulation Method:** Indicate the type of simulation (transient, DC sweep, etc.).
*   **Screenshots:** Include relevant waveforms or simulation results that show SUM and CARRY-OUT for the different input combinations.
*   **Comment on the results:** Confirm that they match your truth table.

## 2.8 Backup and Submission of Design Files

*   List the files you backed up:
    *   *.asc (schematic)
    *   *.asy (symbol)
*   Mention that you will submit these along with your report.

# 3. Part 2: LSB Block Optimization (No Carry-In Input)

## 3.1 Understand the Problem

*   Briefly restate why the LSB block doesn’t need a carry-in input.
*   Clarify the difference between this simpler block and the previous one.

## 3.2 Create a Truth Table for the Simpler Block

*   Only inputs here are likely A and B (since Cin is removed).
*   Show the outputs for SUM and CARRY-OUT (if applicable).

    **Example Layout**

## 3.3 Derive the Logic

*   Show the SOP derivation or any simplifications used.
*   Present the final Boolean expression.

## 3.4 Implementation in LTSpice

*   Translate your simplified logic into an LTSpice schematic.
*   Screenshots or a brief description of how it’s wired.

## 3.5 Create Symbol and Test Schematic

*   Create a block symbol for the simpler LSB.
*   Build a test schematic just like in Part 1 and run a simulation for all possible inputs.

## 3.6 Simulation Results

*   Provide screenshots of the simulation waveforms or final table.
*   Verify that the results match the truth table.

## 3.7 Integration: Replace Original LSB

*   Show or describe how you replaced the old LSB block with the new simpler block in the main circuit.
*   Re-simulate (briefly show results to confirm correct operation).

# 4. Discussion

*   Summarize the key findings and observations (e.g., does the logic behave as predicted, any pitfalls discovered, etc.).
*   If you encountered any design challenges or interesting insights about carry propagation or gate-level implementation, mention them here.

# 5. Conclusion

*   Restate the overall success of the lab:
    > “Both the main block (with carry-in = 0) and the simplified LSB block performed as expected, verifying the correctness of the SOP-derived logic and LTSpice implementation.”
*   Highlight any next steps or additional notes.

# 6. Appendix (Optional)

*   Include any extra screenshots, code snippets, or additional tables that don’t fit neatly in the main body.
*   List references or resources (if any were used), such as textbooks, lecture notes, or websites about Boolean logic or LTSpice.

# Final Checklist

1.  Truth Tables for both the main block and the simpler LSB block.
2.  SOP Derivations for SUM and CARRY-OUT (both blocks).
3.  LTSpice Schematic screenshots (main circuit and test bench for each block).
4.  Simulation Waveforms or tabular results.
5.  Symbol (.asy) files creation details.
6.  Discussion/Analysis of the results.
7.  All files (*.asc and *.asy) ready to submit.

# Submission Notes

*   Combine this part of the lab (Part 1 & Part 2) with Wednesday’s work in a single coherent report.
*   Ensure you adhere to any additional formatting requirements from your instructor (e.g., margins, font size, cover page, etc.).

By following this structure, you’ll have a clear, well-organized report that demonstrates every stage of the project—from concept and design to simulation and backup. Good luck!
