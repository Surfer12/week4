# Unified Style Guide

This document serves as a guide for maintaining clarity, consistency, and overall functionality across the codebase, homework assignments, lab projects, and diagrams. It gathers improvement suggestions into a single reference for future enhancements.

## 1. Homework Assignments

- **Clarity and Expanded Instructions:**
  - Split documents into clearly labeled sections (e.g., "2's Complement Conversions", "SOP and KMap Derivations", "Don't Care Handling").
  - Include mini examples or annotated sample truth tables so that students understand when to mark unused outputs as "X" and treat them as "0" during simplification.

- **Visual Aids:**
  - Embed or link to annotated diagrams and screenshots.
  - Use inline LaTeX or Mermaid diagrams to illustrate derivations (e.g., minimal SOP expressions) and truth table constructions.

- **Formatting and Structure:**
  - Ensure consistent numbering, bullet styling, and layout across documents.
  - Utilize tables or code blocks for truth tables, keeping notation for "don't cares" consistent.
  - Add a "Quick Reference" cheat sheet at the end with key formulas and examples.

## 2. Lab Projects

- **Enhanced Lab Report Instructions:**
  - Clearly detail report sections: include block schematics, simulation screenshots, performance observations, and troubleshooting sections (e.g., "lessons learned").

- **Code Readability and Modularity:**
  - Add detailed comments in C code (e.g., in cache_visualizer.c, memory_operations.c) explaining the purpose of functions and constants.
  - Refactor lengthy files into modular components (e.g., separate simulation, memory operations, performance monitoring).
  - Update the Makefile to include "lint" or "style" targets and ensure it supports cross-platform builds.

- **Strengthened Testing and Error Handling:**
  - Expand test suites in labs/c_language/tests with additional edge case tests and clearer assertions.
  - Include instructions in lab READMEs on running tests and interpreting their outputs.

- **Environment Setup Documentation:**
  - Provide a quick-start guide in labs/c_language/README.md, listing prerequisites and troubleshooting common issues.
  - For performance demos (e.g., in Mojo examples), include a "Getting Started" section.

## 3. Diagrams

- **Interactivity and Clarity:**
  - Consider using interactive tools like Mermaid for live previews of diagrams.
  - Maintain consistent color schemes, icons, and layout styles across all diagram files.

- **Cross-Referencing:**
  - Link diagrams directly within homework and lab documents (e.g., reference docs/diagrams/hardware/memory_hierarchy.md when discussing memory hierarchy).
  - Annotate diagrams to highlight key components such as ALU building blocks or cache performance metrics.

- **Context-Specific Diagrams:**
  - Embed schematic diagrams in lab reports (e.g., adder lab) to illustrate circuitry or component interfaces.
  - Use step-by-step visuals in digital logic notes to complement textual instructions.

## 4. General Codebase Enhancements

- **Unified Style Guide:**
  - Follow a consistent style for code comments, file naming, Markdown formatting, and diagram styling across the repository.

- **Cross-File Navigation:**
  - Include an index or README at the repository root mapping homework assignments, lab projects, and diagrams with direct links and summaries.

- **Automated Checks:**
  - Implement linters for Markdown and C code to enforce style consistency.
  - Consider adding build/test automation (e.g., a "test-all" target in the Makefile) to validate integration between assignments and code examples.

- **Enhancement of Interactive Learning:**
  - Explore embedding runnable code snippets (e.g., via in-browser Code Runner for C or interactive notebooks for digital logic) to make the learning material more dynamic.

This guide is intended to evolve as improvements are implemented and will serve as a central reference for best practices across all components of the project.
